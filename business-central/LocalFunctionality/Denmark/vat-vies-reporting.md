# VAT-VIES Reporting in the Danish Version

Danish companies must submit VAT declarations for trade of goods or services with other EU countries/regions. You can create the required file by using the **EC Sales List** report.

## VAT Registration No. Setup

To ensure accurate VAT-VIES Reporting, you must enter only VAT number in the **VAT Registration No.** on Customer and Vendor cards. That means you cannot add country codes or other shortcuts as VAT-VIES Reporting requires only clear VAT number of clients.

## Reporting EU Sales

In order to track VAT for the trade of goods or services between EU countries/regions, you must submit information about this trade to the Danish Listesystem. The **EC Sales List** report creates a file that you can then upload to the tax authorities at the [www.skat.dk](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=212340) site. Before you create the file, you can verify your customers’ VAT registration number online. The tax authorities also recommend that you do not submit large files to the online portal. If your declaration consists of more than 1,000 lines, it is recommended that you submit several smaller files instead. For more information, see the tax authorities’ [website](https://www.skat.dk).
